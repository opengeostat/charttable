ChartTable
=======

ChartTable generates HTML code of tables for exploratory data analysis. 
These can be rendered in an Ipython Notebook or exported as an HTML document. 
These are the main features implemented: 

- Horizontal bar chart columns. Three variables can be combine in a single column:
	- The text/number value
	- The bar width
    - The bar colours


Current version
----------
version = '0.0.0.1.0'

This means that we are in a very early developing stage and the package 
is experimental!

Ipython notebook templates and examples.
--------------------------
The easiest way to use ChartTable is by modifying the Ipython notebook 
provided as template and examples. Just change some input and enjoy 
the results. 


Installation in Anaconda distribution (Linux/Window/OS)
------------
TODO 


Installation from source (from github.com)
--------------------
This is the most update but unstable development version. You may manually 
install all the dependencies and make sure you have a C compiler available:: 


	git clone https://github.com/opengeostat/charttable.git
	cd charttable
	python setup.py install
